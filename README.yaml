# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to create a peering connection between any two VPCs existing in different AWS accounts. 

  This module supports performing this action from a 3rd account (e.g. a "root" account) by specifying the roles to assume for each member account.
  
  **IMPORTANT:** AWS allows a multi-account VPC Peering Connection to be deleted from either the requester's or accepter's side. However, Terraform only allows the VPC Peering Connection to be deleted from the requester's side by removing the corresponding `aws_vpc_peering_connection` resource from your configuration. [Read more about this](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpc_peering_accepter.html) on Terraform's documentation portal.
